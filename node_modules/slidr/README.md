# Slidr

Probably not the last slider you'll ever need, but a great one nonetheless. The focus of this implementation is to be flexible but without bloat. Its main feature is that will not render anything for you, and you have to provide your own styles.

Goals:

- Tiny
- Extensible
- Do only as much as it needs to do by default, but not more
- No dependencies, that means no React, no Vue, no jQuery.
- Use with any framework
