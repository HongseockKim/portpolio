Version 1.1.2
-------------

    * Fixed two issues preventing Reel from animating itself in IE (Github issue GH-30).
    * Fixed iframe-related bug in IE (Github issue GH-25).
    * Fixed broken-image-overlay bug when using sprite on IE 7 and lower.
    * Fixed the overgrown indicator bug in IE 6.
* Unwanted brief image disappearance of image on start is now eliminated.
* Sprite request duplication eliminated for Firefox and others.
* Laziness factor has been adjusted for better performance on iPhones.
* Revised adaptive ticker:
    * Ticker is now driven by a "leader" - the oldest living instance on page - and `$.reel.leader` references its data. This removes the first-reel-sets-the-tempo limitation in older versions.
    * Overall `$.reel.cost` per timer tick in ms is being continuously calculated and then used to elevate timer accuracy.
    * Several performance tests included.


Version 1.1.1
-------------

* Per document `$.reel.touchy` and `$.reel.lazy` properties added to manifest key user agent qualities.

* Initial frame 1 now doesn't disappear after loading (Github issue GH-11).
* New `center` store key now stores if on the center point in orbital setups.
* iPad has been excluded from "lazy" devices list, because it in fact isn't lazy device at all. This means much fluent experience on iPads.


Version 1.1
-----------

### Animation
* The projector can now self-animate. The animation is controlled with bunch of options.
    * `delay` option for autoplay delay (use -1 to prevent it).
    * `speed` option sets the speed of animation (in Hz).
    * `rebound` options is how long in seconds will a non-looping reel stay on edge before bouncing back from it.
    * `timeout` option is a period of user inactivity after which animation is resumed again.
* To control the animation from outside, new events `"play"`, `"pause"` and `"stop"` have been added.
* Having one shared ticker for animation purposes. `tempo` option sets the speed in ticks per second.
* Slower devices are detected and their tempo is decreased accordingly for better performance.
* Duration of an opening animation is set using new `opening` option. Custom opening speed can be set using new `entry` option.

### Rendering
* Suggestive open/closed palm cursor used for mouse pointer over the projector.
* iPhone downsizing bug is gone, however it decreases visual quality to fit in memory.
* Image(s) loading status is now indicated by a horizontal progress bar at the bottom of the image. Height of the loader indicator can be adjusted by using new `preloader` option.
* Added `monitor` option accepting a string key of any value stored within. It is then displayed in the upper left corner of the viewport.
* Teardown sequence now wipes out everything.

### Math
* Decimal fraction is now used as a base for internal computations instead of using frames.
    * `steps` option divides Reel into different amount of steps other than defined by `frames`.
    * `step` option can be used to override initial `frame` option.

### Events
* Instance now emits "loaded" event after image(s) preloading is done.
* Internal data storage now report every manipulation by "store" or "recall" events. Name and value are passed as additional params to the handler.

### Interaction
* New `draggable`, `wheelable` and `throwable` options added for interaction style control.
* New boolean `clickfree` option which causes binding to mouseenter/leave events rather than down/up for click-free interaction.
* Prevented text selection of the projector on iPhone.

### Multi-Row Object Movies
* You can no go beyond the simple 360° with support for multiple horizontal rows.
    * `rows` option sets the vertical rows count.
    * `row` the initial row on which to start.

### Dual-Axis Object Movies
* New `orbital` option allows to specify centering tolerance and the movie is switched to dual-axis mode for one horizontal plus one vertical orbit.

### Sequence of Images
* Added the `image` option which allows custom image sprite to be used.
* Array of individual `images` can now be supplied instead of using a collective sprite - this feature effectively overcomes the memory limit on iPhone imposed on large JPEG sprites exhibited by downsizing the sprite. See [FAQ][faq] for more on this.

### Other Options
* All default options are now made available for manipulation as `$.reel.def` object.
* The `sensitivity` option has become obsolete and had been removed.
* The problematic `saves` option does no longer make sense (as there is no other option) and had been removed all together.
* The `hotspot` option deprecated in favor to new `area` to stop being misleading.
* New `directional` boolean option to flag bi-directional sprites.
* New `laziness` option allows to customize the tempo divisor for lazy devices.

### Content Delivery Network
* Reel's own cloud CDN has been started and recommended for use instead of download.
* For convenience, a "bundle" is available on the [CDN][cdn] and it contains Reel along side with jQuery.mouseWheel and jQuery.disableTextSelect optional plugins.

Version 1.0.3
-------------
* User *neptune* (thanks!) found a nasty mishap where option `tooltip` was used instead of `hint` on several places. To stay backwards compatible `tooltip` will stay as an alias of new option `hint` (which is preferred).


Version 1.0.2
-------------
* Added support for counter-clockwise sprite by specifying option `reversed`
* Validation of tags on which reel is applied added. Only IMG tags with assigned all `src`, `width` and `height` pass.
